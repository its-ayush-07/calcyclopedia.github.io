         <div class="cult-des"><aside>Christmas in New York, Rio Carnival in Brazil, and the La Tomatina Festival in Spain summed up cannot beat the magnitude of the Durga Puja celebrations in Kolkata, India. Celebrated in September or October, Durga Puja spans 10 days filled with packed elaborate rituals. You will find a stunning display of creativity and art in the form of innovative themed pandals and idols. It is almost impossible to pen down the grandeur of experiencing Durga Puja in words.
          Nabakrishna Deb started the Durga Puja in Shobhabazar Rajbari in 1757. He set a pattern for the puja, which became a fashion and status symbol among the upcoming merchant class of Kolkata. After she died in 1861, the sons-in-law took to celebrating Durga Puja in their respective premises.

        <div class="food-des"><aside>Calcutta or Kolkata biryani evolved from the Lucknow style, when Awadh's last Nawab Wajid Ali Shah was exiled in 1856 to the Kolkata suburb of Metiabruz. Shah brought his personal chef with him. The poorer households of Kolkata, which could not afford meat, used potatoes instead, which went on to become a specialty of the Calcutta biryani. The Calcutta biryani primarily uses meat and potatoes. The Calcutta biryani is much lighter on spices. The marinade uses primarily nutmeg, cinnamon, mace along with cloves and cardamom in the dahi-based marinade for the meat which is cooked separately from rice. This combination of spices gives it a distinct flavour compared to other styles of biryani. The rice is flavoured with ketaki water or rose water along with saffron to give it flavour and a light yellowish colour.
